# A* Visualizer
This project is a visualization of the A* path finding algorithm.

This path finding visualizer consists of a grid which currently has hard-coded start and end nodes to form the path, I do intend to update it so that the user is able to manually select the start and end nodes. The project uses the A* path finding algorithm to calculate the shortest path between the two nodes. The user is able to draw any amount of obstacles on the grid. The reset button resets the path and empties the grid of any obstacles. The random button resets the path and randomly adds obstacles to the grid.
